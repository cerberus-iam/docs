## Notes

- This is a **soft delete** operation - the user record is marked as deleted but retained in the database
- Soft-deleted users will not appear in list or get operations
- All active sessions for the user are terminated upon deletion
- The user's email address remains reserved and cannot be reused for new accounts
- An audit log entry is created for this action with the deleter's information
- Tenant isolation ensures users can only delete users within their organisation
- The deleter's user ID, IP address, and user agent are recorded in the audit log
- Consider blocking users instead of deleting if temporary suspension is desired
- Hard deletion (permanent data removal) requires direct database access and is not exposed via the API
- Related data (sessions, tokens, audit logs) may be handled according to the service's data retention policy
