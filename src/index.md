Overview

The Identity and Access Management (IAM) API enables you to programmatically manage user authentication, authorization, and access control within your applications. Built on Laravel and Laravel Passport, our API provides enterprise-grade identity management capabilities through a RESTful interface.

Current Version

The current version is v1. Access the API at:

```

Authentication

All API requests require authentication using OAuth 2.0 Bearer tokens. Include your token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer your-access-token
```

Learn more about authentication in our [Authentication Guide](/authentication).

Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure stability:

60 requests per minute per client
Rate limit details included in response headers
See our [Rate Limiting Guide](/rate-limits) for more information
